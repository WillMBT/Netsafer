      <h1><b>What are Online Scams?</b></h1>
      <div class="desc1">Online scams, also known as internet scams, continue to evolve and can vary widely. 
        The term generally refers to someone using internet services or software to defraud or take advantage of victims, typically for financial gain.

        Cybercriminals may contact potential victims through personal or work email accounts, social networking sites, dating apps, or other methods in attempts to obtain financial or other valuable personal information.
        Many successful scams on the internet have similar endings: The victim loses their own money or fails to receive funds the cybercriminal promised. In worst-case scenarios, the victim might even lose their identity.

      <h1><b>What are Common Scams?</b></h1>
      <div class="desc2">Cybercriminals can send emails or messages that appear genuine but actually contain harmful content. <br>
        Be wary of any email or message that claims to be from an organisation or a friend that seems slightly off or doesn’t include a personal message. <br>
        Encourage children to ask an adult before they open emails and messages.<br><br>

        Emails that claim you’ve won a prize can seem the most appealing, but try to remember if you entered a competition or if you recognise the email address.<br>
         Teaching children how to spot scam emails can help to keep them safe online. <br>
         There are countless other types of scams that are present in the online world. These can range from romance scams to tax scams to lottery scams, and everything in between.<br>
         It is important that the significance of scams is not underestimated, and knowledge that it can happen to anyone, even experienced internet users.

      <h1><b>How to avoid them?</b></h1>
      <div class="desc3"><u>If it's too good to be true, it probably is.</u><br>

       By being aware of what scams look like, you can avoid them by showing caution when dealing with situations such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>Contact that is out of the blue </li>
  <li>Getting told there’s a problem with your phone, laptop or internet connections  </li>
    <li>Being asked for passwords </li>
      <li>Needing to verify your account or details </li>
        <li>Trying to get you to move outside of an online trading or booking website or app (like Air BnB)</li>
          <li>Offering money or a prize in exchange for something up front </li>
            <li>Being asked for money by friends/partners you’ve met online </li>
              <li>Unusual ways to pay for something </li>
                <li>Asking for remote access to your device </li>
                  <li>Pressuring you to make a decision quickly </li>
</ul>
